## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r packages, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
```

```{r data_import, include=FALSE}
data_full <- read.table("data_full.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE, dec=".")
data_precip <- data_full[, -5]
data_temp <- data_full[, -4]
```

```{r temp_map, echo=FALSE}
t <- ggplot(data_temp, aes(x = lon, y = lat, colour = tmoy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_sf() + # seems to be what people use for map, in general
  labs(title = "Année : {frame_time}", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude")

t_anim <- t + transition_time(Date) +
  ease_aes("linear")

anim_save("figures/temp_map_anim.gif", t_anim)

t_anim
# CURRENTLY IN DAYS, average over years for maps?
# -> For rain, years; for temp, months over 1 year (pivot: 2052, 2010 for historical)
```
